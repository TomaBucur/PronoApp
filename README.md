# Prono

It's a social pronostics application meant for people who love sports, but mostly football enthusiasts at this moment(we plan to grow to implement this concept on other sports too). You can compete against others football lovers and see who can predict the closest leagues and cups matches between well known teams. By simply join a tournament of your choice and select the scores you feel that are most appropriate for the matches to close with you can be prove to the other players from the tournament and maybe from other cities/countries and who knows, maybe continents that you are the best when it comes to predictions. Beside the main futures of pronostics, you can chat and make new friends inside the application.
